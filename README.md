🚀 Thrilled to Share My Latest Internship Project at @Cognifyz Technologies! 🚀

During my data science internship, I had the opportunity to dive deep into a Level 3 Restaurant Data Analysis Report. This multifaceted project involved:

🔍 Predictive Modeling of Restaurant Ratings:

Implemented various machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Ridge and Lasso Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost. Achieved significant insights with Gradient Boosting Regression as the standout performer, providing the lowest mean squared error and highest R² score, showcasing its strength in capturing complex relationships.

🍽️ Customer Preference Analysis:

Explored cuisine preferences by analyzing vote counts and ratings, revealing that North Indian, Chinese, and Italian cuisines are the most popular, while World Cuisine and Western dishes scored highest in customer satisfaction. Discovered a weak negative correlation between vote count and average ratings, suggesting that while popularity doesn’t always equate to high ratings, there’s potential to promote highly-rated yet less popular cuisines.

📊 Data Visualization:

Created visualizations to uncover hidden patterns in the data: Rating Distribution: Most ratings clustered around 3-4 stars, indicating general satisfaction but room for improvement. Cuisine Ratings Comparison: Highlighted that less popular cuisines, such as World Cuisine and Western, received higher average ratings. City Ratings Comparison: Analyzed city-wise rating trends to identify regional variations in restaurant quality. Feature Relationships: Investigated how vote counts and price ranges relate to ratings, revealing nuanced insights into customer preferences. This project not only enhanced my technical skills in predictive modeling and data visualization but also provided actionable insights for optimizing restaurant services and improving customer satisfaction.
